## GIT Best Practices for PR Reviews

# Am I on my feature branch ?
git branch 

# Check if you have left any changes un-committed
git status

# Replace develop with the name of your integration branch
git checkout develop 

# Telling git to just check if there were any changes in remote repo
git fetch origin -p 

# Bring the delta changes, but applying rebase strategy
git pull --rebase origin develop 

# Switching over to my feature branch
git checkout feature/my-new-cool-feature

# Applying any changes that have gotten merged into develop onto my feature branch
git rebase develop

# Now I am ready to raise a pull request
git push origin feature/my-new-cool-feature
